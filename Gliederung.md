#Gliederung Paper
## What is delta debugging?
	- papers: "Yesterday my program worked, today it does not. Why?", "Why programs fail"
	- Basic principle (yesterday, today, goal)

## Definitions and basework
	- papers: sa.
	- configurations and their properties
	- problems: interference and inconsistency

## The dd+ algorithm
	- papers: sa.
	- dd+

## Using DD to minimize random unit test cases
	- (shows how DD can be used as an abstract method in different settings)
	- papers: "Random unit test case minimization", "Simplfying and isolating failure inducing input"
	- ddmin
	- (ssmin + ddmin => sdmin)




# Gliederung Vortrag
## Background and motivation
	- Debugging sucks, everybody hates it
	- Even people in the nineties hated it
	- ... Version Control exists => Delta Debugging is possible
	- explain idea and basic principle

## Problems and how to solve them: The dd+ algorithm
	- idea sounds easy enough but problems exist
	- interference
	- inconsistency
	- dd+ solves it all

## Case study

## DD today: Tool that is used in different settings and foundation of different solutions
