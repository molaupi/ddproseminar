\subsection{The DD principle as a tool}
\begin{frame}{Using DD to find the reason a program fails}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \ddp\ algorithm as described above can be used to find out which part of a certain input is responsible for crashing a program.
		\item From a developers perspective it would be great to know \textit{why} this specific input induces failure.
	\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Using DD to find the reason a program fails}
	\begin{alertblock}{Difficulty: Causalities from the input change to the failure}
		A minimal change in the input has major consequences for the program execution. How can the debugger know which chain of effects is responsible for the eventual failure?
	\end{alertblock}

	\pause

	\begin{exampleblock}{Idea: Delta Debugging on program states}
		Use delta debugging on program states of a known succeeding run $r_\cmark$ and a known failing run $r_\xmark$ of the program. For each analyzed pair of program states we would then know what current difference causes the failure down the line.

		\bigskip

		$\Rightarrow$ A \textit{Cause-Effect-Chain} can be constructed from those comparisons.
	\end{exampleblock}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Delta Debugging on program states}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A program state is essentially a set of $(variable, value)$ pairs.
		\item A program state of $r_\cmark$ and one of $r_\xmark$ can have the following differences (the deltas): \begin{itemize}
			\item A variable only present in one state
			\item A different value of a variable present in both states
		\end{itemize}
		\item With this the runs $r_\cmark$ and $r_\xmark$ can be compared in different significant locations. 
		\item We use delta debugging to find the current $(variable, value)$ pairs that are responsible for the failure of $r_\xmark$ further down the line.
	\end{itemize}

	%\bigskip

	%$\Rightarrow$ This allows us to build a \textit{Cause-Effect-Chain} that helps understand why the program fails.
